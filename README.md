# Fox-Quest

#### 2D platformer game delelopved using Unity and C#

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A game, inspired by Sierra Entertainment’s classic called King’s Quest, which follows on the adventure of a fox that lost its mom during a fire in the forest. For this specific scene, the fox meets a skunk who saw its mom and will show Fox the way only if Fox can help him collect three moles. Fox must avoid fire, lava floor, and robots along the way to collect the moles. It can only get coins that can help it in the future. After catching all three moles, Skunk will tell him the direction, and the player moves on to the next scene which will be implemented in the future.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Players can move Fox by pressing the left and right buttons or jump by pressing the space key. To mute the background music, the player can press the “M” key. The kill boxes are fire, lava floor, and robots which can move around in a certain range.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All the sprites and music files were collected on the Asset Store, itch.io, or other free platforms.
